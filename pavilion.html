                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p class="circulartxt">The Pavilion for Holland Park was a final project for IAT 233 Spatial Design. A 4-person group project in which we were tasked with a design proposal for a concert hall pavilion and pergola in Holland Park for the City of Surrey. The pavilion and pergola needed to fit within a 15m x 15m base, accounting for human factors principles and circulation patterns and include two architectural syntactic languages, ours being massing and layered architecture. The final deliverables consisted of 3D Rhino model and rendering of the structures and a physical model of the pergola. Within this project, I was responsible for creating ideation sketches, making the Rhino Pavilion model, creating a video of the building in Twinmotion and constructing the physical pergola model.</p>

                    <h3>Stage 1: Ideation</h3>
                    <p>In the ideation stage, our group established wanting to make the building as accessible as possible and we were inspired by classical theatre halls like Queen Elizabeth Theatre. I had the idea of using a collage of basic shapes to create a general shape for the pavilion and pergola structures. We were given critiques from our peers on the structure. From there, each member made ideation sketches to improve the pavilionâ€™s design based on the feedback.

                    <h3>Stage 2: Refinement</h3>
                    <p class="circulartxt">One main piece of feedback was the top floor would not be comfortable for wheelchair users to stay comfortable. The initial design of the second level was a slope. However, one thing that our group failed to recognize was how problematic the slope is for wheelchair users as it would cause their chairs to roll forward and be difficult to mount normal chairs to the floor. With this in mind, I drew sketches including flat surfaces while restricted by the sloping nature of the top floor and incorporate an area for easy access for wheelchair users.

                    <h3>Stage 3: Implementation and Reflection</h3>
                    <p>With the Rhino model, I initially made the general structure using boolean commands like subtraction and union. However, I had to keep in mind how the materials for different sections of the building would interact with each, especially when importing the structure into Twinmotion. This proved difficult as I had made the general structure into one object instead of multiple parts, resulting in the structure in Twinmotion only using one material instead of multiple.

                    Overall, this project taught me that even the smallest of aesthetic details can impact the overall experience of users and you need to be creative to find the best solution.
