                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p class="circulartxt">For IAT 333, a senior design course on interaction design methods, students were tasked with creating a design solution for existing small businesses. For this 13-week service design project, we collaborated with an existing small business, Turquoise Goat, in which myself and three teammates endeavored to enhance the current customer experience to attract new customers and increase customer retention. Our final solution was the creation of a series of cinematic collectible Turquoise Goat trading cards.

                    <p>Turquoise Goat is a queer-owned 90’s themed board game cafe located in the Gastown neighbourhood that aims to create a comfortable space that’s “1000% cooler than your living room”. A hang-out space for all ages, customers have access to a plethora board games and can enjoy fun, nostalgic meals and snacks and handcrafted cocktails/beverages.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Stage 1: Reseach</h3>
                    <p>To identify the possible business challenges within Turquoise Goat (TG), we conducted ethnographic research through in-field observations and interviews with employees and past-patrons. From the research gathered we discovered that there were multiple areas of exploration including: intended versus actual dining experience; lack of board game catalogue, and awareness of brand values. As a group, we concluded that awareness of TG’s brand values was a primary consideration for its owners. We wanted to communicate their mission of inclusivity and accessibility to a wider customer base and to share their unique entertainment/dining experience. Thus we leveraged the business' unique personality to enhance the unique characteristics of TG, attract new customers, promote brand awareness and keep them coming back.

                    <h3>Stage 2: Ethnography and Participatory Workshop</h3>
                    <p class="circulartxt">Through participatory workshops with TG’s co-owner and customers, our group engaged stakeholders in a design sprint to understand what is a destination and what makes TG a desirable destination. Within the workshop, we set up 3 activities: an ice breaker doodling activity, crazy 8s, Rose/thorn/bud. Each activity aimed to generate ideas and gather insight from different perspectives

                    <h3>Stage 3: Reframing and Refinement</h3>
                    <p>From our findings, 3 new possible solutions were identified but ultimately we moved forward with the design of TG trading cards. The TG trading cards are a series of cinematic mosaic trading cards that showcases the TG mascot as the different types of players that visit TG. We concluded that this solution best fit within the TG established brand. In the TG community, much of its customer base are board game enthusiasts, card collectors and fantasy fanatics.

                    <h3>Stage 4: Implementation and Reflection</h3>
                    <p> From a business perspective, there is opportunity for future expansion ie. expansion packs, seasonal cards, themed packs.  The trading cards also created a meaningful token that customers can take with them as a reminder of the cafe and fits within the existing TG merchandise and collectible items being sold.   From a customer perspective, we concluded that, if popular, it would make customers want to visit again to collect more cards/buy more packs.  There is already a large subset of TG customers that are fans of trading cards and the goat characters within each card exhibit fun and relatable personalities that customers can identify with.

                    <p>
                        Upon reflecting on this project, my biggest takeaways were not to get too attached to an outcome and to follow the research and data given how important they are in informing your design decisions. Throughout this process, I engaged extensively with clients and developed communication skills in a business setting.  I was able to succinctly articulate the outcome of our research and work collaboratively with a team that had very diverse skill sets. I also learned how to utilize methods of ethnography and ideation to come up with an impactful solution for our client, Turquoise Goat.
